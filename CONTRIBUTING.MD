Im not a fan of too much writing so here is...
* Clear consice code will be much appreiciated
* Understandable code is better than cool abstract logic
* We encourage making use of the created functions and methodologies as much as possible
* Comments are much appreciated as well as good variable and method names
* Always run tests before sending a PR
* Read through the code as much as possible before making any edits

### Neutral Info
* LF line endings
* 4 spaces indentation
* You can refer to TODO.MD to know what functionalities need to be implemented\
